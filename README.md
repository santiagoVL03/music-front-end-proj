## AWS S3 Deployment

This project is deployed as a static website using **Amazon S3** for hosting. The deployment takes advantage of S3's static website hosting capabilities to serve the built Vue.js application.

### S3 Bucket Configuration

**Bucket Name**: `musiccloud-frontend-santiago`

The bucket is configured with:

1. **Static Website Hosting**: Enabled to serve the Vue.js SPA
2. **Public Read Access**: Configured via bucket policy to allow public access to all objects
3. **Bucket Policy**: Applied to grant `s3:GetObject` permission to all users

### Bucket Policy

The following bucket policy is applied to allow public read access:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::musiccloud-frontend-santiago/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

This policy enables anyone to read objects from the bucket, which is necessary for serving the website to users.

### Deployment Process

The deployment process involves two main steps:

1. **Build the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command:
   - Runs TypeScript type checking with `vue-tsc`
   - Compiles and bundles the Vue.js application using Vite
   - Generates optimized production files in the `dist/` directory
   - Minifies JavaScript and CSS
   - Optimizes assets for production

2. **Sync to S3 Bucket**:
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync dist/ s3://musiccloud-frontend-santiago/ --delete
   ```
   This command:
   - Uploads all files from the `dist/` directory to the S3 bucket
   - Uses the `--delete` flag to remove files from S3 that are no longer in `dist/`
   - Only uploads changed files for efficient deployment
   - Preserves the directory structure

### Deployment Benefits

Using AWS S3 for hosting provides several advantages:

- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for storage and bandwidth used
- **Scalability**: Automatically handles traffic spikes
- **High Availability**: Built-in redundancy and durability
- **Fast Content Delivery**: Low latency for static assets
- **Simple Deployment**: Easy sync with AWS CLI
- **Version Control**: Can maintain multiple versions of the site

### Prerequisites for Deployment

To deploy this project to AWS S3, you need:

1. **AWS Account**: Active AWS account with appropriate permissions
2. **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured with credentials
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
3. **S3 Bucket**: Created with static website hosting enabled
4. **Bucket Policy**: Applied to allow public read access (see policy above)

### Accessing the Deployed Website

Once deployed, the website can be accessed via:

- **S3 Website Endpoint**: `http://musiccloud-frontend-santiago.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com`
- Replace `<region>` with your bucket's AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`)

### Alternative Deployment Options

While this project uses S3, it can also be deployed to:

- **Kubernetes**: Using the included `frontent.yaml` deployment configuration
- **Docker**: Using the included `dockerfile` for containerization
- **CloudFront**: For CDN capabilities and custom domain support
- **Other Static Hosts**: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.

## Development

### Code Style

The project uses:

- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vue 3 Composition API for reactive components

### Component Architecture

- **Composables**: Reusable logic for API calls and state management
- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Views**: Page-level components
- **Services**: API integration layer
- **Types**: TypeScript interfaces and type definitions

## API Requirements

Make sure your backend API is running on `http://localhost:8000` and implements the following endpoints:

1. **POST /usuarios**
   - Body: `{ name: string, email: string }`
   - Response: User object

2. **PUT /usuarios/{id}/estado**
   - Body: `{ status: 'active' | 'inactive' }`
   - Response: Updated user object

3. **POST /usuarios/{id}/musica**
   - Body: `{ songId: number }`
   - Response: Updated user object with music library

4. **GET /musica**
   - Response: Array of song objects

5. **GET /usuarios/{id}**
   - Response: User object with music library

6. **POST /musica**
   - Body: `{ title: string, artist: string, album?: string, duration?: number, genre?: string }`
   - Response: Created song object
